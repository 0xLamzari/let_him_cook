- uvicorn ASGI:     https://www.uvicorn.org/
- pytest:           https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/



COMMANDS:
- Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

- Activate it (MUST ALWAYS ACTIVATE IT)
.\venv\Scripts\activate

- On macOS (for them to test it)
source venv/bin/activate

- install fastapi
pip install "fastapi[standard]"

- "dump" current dependencies to dep file
pip freeze > requirements.txt

- install dependencies from a dep file
pip install -r requirements.txt

- run app with uvicorn from root folder:
uvicorn app.main:app --reload


NOTES:
- pytest wasn't working properly since I didn't install it in the venv but I was using the global package (the error about module imports was misguiding)
- why relative imports don't work when the app is run from let_him_cook\ instead of let_him_cook\app\  ?
- what are __init__ files for?
